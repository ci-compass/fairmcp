## Welcome to FAIR MCP Documentation

This site provides comprehensive documentation about FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and their implementation through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Test Python Code

```{python}
print("Hello from Python!")

# A simple function to demonstrate code execution
def fair_acronym():
    return {
        "F": "Findable",
        "A": "Accessible",
        "I": "Interoperable",
        "R": "Reusable"
    }

fair = fair_acronym()
for letter, meaning in fair.items():
    print(f"{letter}: {meaning}")
```

### About This Project

FAIRMCP combines FAIR principles with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a comprehensive framework for scientific data management.

According to @wilkinson2016fair, FAIR principles are essential for maximizing the value of research data.
