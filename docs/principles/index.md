## FAIR Principles Overview

The FAIR Principles are a set of guidelines for scientific data management and stewardship, designed to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

According to @wilkinson2016fair, these principles are essential for ensuring that digital resources remain valuable for both humans and machines in scientific research.

### Findable

Data should be easy to find for both humans and machines:
- F1: (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- F2: Data are described with rich metadata
- F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4: (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

### Accessible

Data should be accessible, even when the data are no longer available:
- A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol
- A2: Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

### Interoperable

Data should be able to be integrated with other data and work with applications for analysis, storage, and processing:
- I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation
- I2: (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3: (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

### Reusable

Data should be well-described to enable reuse:
- R1: (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
